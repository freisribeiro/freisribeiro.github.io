### The Photon

The research meeting today was based on the manipulation of “The Photon”. The Photon is a development kit for creating Wi-Fi connected products (and the spiritual sequel to the popular Spark Core). It's based on Broadcom's WICED architecture, and combines a powerful STM32 ARM Cortex M3 microcontroller and a Broadcom Wi-Fi chip (the same one that's in Nest Protect, LIFX, and Amazon Dash).
